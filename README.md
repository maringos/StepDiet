# Repository For Supplementary Data & Code
This repository contains the Supplementary Data and R code for the manuscript "Defining the nutritional input for genome-scale metabolic models: a roadmap" by Georgios Marinos, Christoph Kaleta, and Silvio Waschina submitted for peer-reviewing in the journal "XXX".


OVERVIEW
========

Genome-wide metabolic models have become very popular in various research areas including biomedicine and environmental studies. This manuscript focuses on pointing the important steps towards designing realistic nutrional input for these models. To this end, we presented the design of the nutrient-rich Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (see folder S1_File) and we applied it to the published metabolic models ‘e_coli_core‘ and ‘iJO1366’  of Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (downloaded from http://bigg.ucsd.edu/; see folder R).
